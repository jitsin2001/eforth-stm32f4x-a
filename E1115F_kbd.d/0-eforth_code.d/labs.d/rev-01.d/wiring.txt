The keyboard translator module (PS/2 to USART or to TTL)
needs 5 volts to operate a PS/2 keyboard.  This can be
a lot of current, up to 200 mA, iirc.

+5VDC is to be supplied by a 120 VAC to USB-A wall wart,
via USB to 2.1 mm barrel plug, and a female inline
barrel jack (broken out to screw terminals).

That goes to a distribution bus (white plastic).

That bus supplies:

   * keyboard module E111F
   * nothing else at the moment
   * later: the Lumex 96x8 RGB display

So, for now, the distibution bus can be omitted, and
just use the female DC 2.1 barrel jack w/terminals,
to gain +5VDC for the keyboard dongle - sharing ground
to the STM32F405 Express.

END.
