Since the E1115F has been validated (basically) it is
near the time to wire it to the STM32F405 Express board
(PC6 and PC7 come to mind; verify that).

Only one of those will be utilized, since the dongle
does not listen on any pin.  Or, not as a USART does.

Unless that fact was missed, during brief examination
of the documentation. (needs verif.)

Comms

The pin right next to the ground, on the PiUART, is the
one to talk to.  This is the Raspberry Pi TX pin, so that
is entirely consistent (here, the E1115F TX pin is
substituted for the RPi's TX pin).

Only the E1115F side gets the clamping diodes, as there
is no convenient reference, to do so on the PiUART side
(CP2104 based dongle).

Keyboard recognized as expected.

Only the ordinary alpha keys, backspace, and CR made
much sense - all the others printed nonsense (which
is somewhat expected; have not studied any of the
encodings outlined in the E1115F datasheet).

They look single or double-byte-ish (every other
keystroke seems to produce a similar garbage symbol
in the terminal (picocom was used).

for: Locus Engineering E1115F PS/2 to Serial/TTL dongle

Smoke tested good - keyboard LED lights up, and a monitor
LED blinks when a key is pressed.

5VDC wall-wart used, no protection.  Breadboard.  Plan on
using the 3.3V terminal of E1115F to clamp diodes on TX and
RX lines.

Raise B1 to get 115k otherwise 57.6k bps

The keyboard translator module (PS/2 to USART or to TTL)
needs 5 volts to operate a PS/2 keyboard.  This can be
a lot of current, up to 200 mA, iirc.

+5VDC is to be supplied by a 120 VAC to USB-A wall wart,
via USB to 2.1 mm barrel plug, and a female inline
barrel jack (broken out to screw terminals).

That goes to a distribution bus (white plastic).

That bus supplies:

   * keyboard module E1115F
   * nothing else at the moment
   * later: the Lumex 96x8 RGB display

So, for now, the distibution bus can be omitted, and
just use the female DC 2.1 barrel jack w/terminals,
to gain +5VDC for the keyboard dongle - sharing ground
to the STM32F405 Express.

END.
