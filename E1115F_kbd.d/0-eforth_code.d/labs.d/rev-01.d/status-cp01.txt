Renamed this to reflect it is a copy of the earlier one.

Cloned the repository to identify and commit files to
be included, separating them from those that won't be
included.

A push will be done in a moment (locally, to this one
branch) to try to merge the work properly.

Previous edits (of this status file) follow.

LED D13 Adafruit STM32F405 Express, blinks on command.

GPIOCEN seems enabled by firmware (eForth kernel).

Some skeletal code for support of a second USART is
either already in a commit (from this very directory)
or is on disk, but not commited.

The delay in getting D13 functioning well has added
a bit of confusion as to USART setup (too much of a
side project; the main project of E1115F support was
not much advanced, this day).
