GPIOA, unused in eForth (forth, ascii source)
GPIOB, USART1, PB6/PB7, eForth interpreter. Unused in current eForth ascii source
GPIOC, USART6, PC6/PC7, eForth ascii Lumex display port.
GPIOD  LED's in eForth ascii source, pins 6, BCDEF all GPIO LED.
       None of this is available on the Adafruit target.

 91 : led 6 ; \ PD6 convenience selection
 92 : led!  GPIOD_BSRR! ; ( n -- )
 93 : on BSX led! ; ( n -- )
 94 : off BRX led! ; ( n -- )

So, GPIOD (not available Adafruit STM) does all the LED ON/OFF stuff.

GPIOA not used at all in eForth, iirc.  May be a candidate
for 'simple' LED blinking.

PA6 and PA7 possibly.  They are A2, A3 on Adafruit target.

PC1 is D13 Adafruit STM.  How difficult to set that up in eForth.
Share GPIOC between E1115F (repurposed Lumex USART6) and LED D13 (PC1).

The ported program is to use only GPIOC, and borrow ideas from
prior uses of GPIOD, but not to use that (GPIOD) itself.

First step, then, is to comment out all GPIOD references.



  Points:

    * eforth only talks to USART1 and USART6

    * Adafruit talks via USB, iirc, so DM DP mapping no clobber
          PA11  DM
          PA12  DP

    * eforth usually updated via ST-LINK, Discovery, for kernel (only)

    * eforth already loaded, F405 Express, talking on USART1 SDA/SCL Adafruit silcscreen pair

          PB6   SCL  USART1_TX
          PB7   SDA  USART1_RX


    * USART6 looking more likely for E1115F connections.

          PC6   USART6_TX D6
          PC7   USART6_RX D5

Adafruit used:

  PA - USB
  PB - i2c USART1
       PB10 TX_D1 USART3_TX D1
       PB11 RX_D0 USART3_RX D0

  PC - blinkers

  PD - SD card (one pin, PD2)
