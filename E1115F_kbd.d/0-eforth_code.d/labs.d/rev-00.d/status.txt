LED D13 Adafruit STM32F405 Express, blinks on command.

GPIOCEN seems enabled by firmware (eForth kernel).

Some skeletal code for support of a second USART is
either already in a commit (from this very directory)
or is on disk, but not commited.

The delay in getting D13 functioning well has added
a bit of confusion as to USART setup (too much of a
side project; the main project of E1115F support was
not much advanced, this day).
