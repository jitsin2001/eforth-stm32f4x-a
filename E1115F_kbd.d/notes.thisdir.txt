The method to read from USART6 is expected to be
found in Dr. Ting's assembler source code.

First order of the day is to try to get what's
already been coded (in Forth ascii source code)
in some semblance of order, by blindly importing
existing work.

The existing work was targeted to writing to the
Lumex 96x8 RGB display panel.

This time, that same code base will be (possibly)
tasked not for (just?) writing, buf for reading
(scanning the USART, or servicing its states of
request).

This is mostly unknown at this hour.

Seems possible to, at a minimum, import some code
that sets up the USART and its baud rate for
communication, and (perhaps) test it for some
semblance of correct operation - leveraging the
CP2104 module that is at hand.

No wiring has been done, at this juncture, so the
very first iterations will mostly be to code in
self-consistent Forth, testing for a simple non-
interference with existing work.


END.
